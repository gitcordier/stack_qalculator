# Roadmap (toward a first backlog)


## Perspectives
### About more "goodies" and personnalization
As long as an operation can be implemented as an N-argument (N>0) function, 
it can be a new feature of our calculator, with only little change in the code.  
Hence, there is virtually no limit to the range of operators we can offer. 
This encompasses all customary operations that users could define themselves.

### About concurrency

#### Technology/prototyping
Our design allows as many stacks as desired.
We do not believe there is a rising demand for collective pocket calculatorsâ€¦ 
But developing servers monitoring concurrent tasks trough a unique and easy-to-grasp API might be much more useful.
Beginning with elementary arithmetic computations could be a good start from scratch, especially for electrical consumptiom benchmarking.


#### Educational/evangelisation  purposes.
Once the underlying engineering model is perfectly bounded, it shall be possible to measure the average heat provided by the **erasure** of a stack, at given complexity.
It is not going to be a scientific breakthrough but it might be part of the current momentum about energetical wisdom.


### About graphic & UX design
Pocket calculators only display the final result. Displaying the whole set of performed operations could be of a great deal of help.
